use thor
list instances and ami's
launch = fire up new instance
specify = create new instance template
destroy = destroys an instance
start = start an instance
stop = stop an instance
snapshot (all volumes associated with ami)
clone = create an ami, and build a new ami with it


instance templates should
    define chef recipies to run
    define the config.json
        specify the server name in the AWS control panel
    create the userdata.sh
    create the packet

Packet/userdata.sh should set the hostname of the box
    and write a custom recipe
    and register the recipe with chef-server
